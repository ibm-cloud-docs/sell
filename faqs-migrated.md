# FAQs for migrated products
{: #migrated-products}

FAQs about products that are migrated from the resource management console might include questions about Lite plans, changing pricing plans, and brokers connected to approved pricing plans.
{: shortdesc}

To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).

## Why can't I add new block tier usage-based plans?
{: #usage-based-plans}

Block tier pricing plans are not currently supported in Partner Center. If you set up a block tier pricing plan in the resource management console and the plan was approved and published, no changes have been made and it was migrated as-is with your product. However, you can't edit the plan or set up a new block tier pricing plan. If you have any questions, open a support case. For information about opening a support case, see [Creating a Partner Center support case](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-pc-support#pc-support-case).

## What changed with Lite plan support?
{: #lite-plans-support}

Lite plans are not supported in Partner Center. You can create a new free plan, and all users with Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts can try out your product for free.

If you set up a Lite plan in the resource management console, and it was approved and published, no changes have been made and it was migrated as-is with your product. If you need to change a published pricing plan, open a support case. For information about opening a support case, see [Creating a Partner Center support case](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-pc-support#pc-support-case).

## Can I add a broker per location?
{: #broker-plans}

No. Brokers are added per pricing plan, not per location. And, brokers can't be disconnected from already approved plans.

## Can I set different locations per plan for a single product?
{: #locations}

Yes. But, all plans for a single product must be set as either global or per location. Therefore, you can't have a plan that is set to global and then another plan set to be available for specific regions. This means that all plans are set as global, or you can select the per location option, and specify different regions and data centers per plan. This applies to all new products. If you have a migrated product that has global and per location plans already set up, no changes have been made to your migrated product, but all new products must have plans that use either global or per location options.


## Why can't I edit my support information?
{: #migrated-support}

The support details that you previously provided to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} aren't currently displayed on the Support tab in Partner Center, but they have been saved and are still available for all of your published products. We are improving the support details experience in Partner Center, so if you need to make any changes, we ask that you contact support. No information was lost or changed during the migration, and all of your published products include your support details. For information about opening a support case, see [Creating a Partner Center support case](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-pc-support#pc-support-case).

## Where is my custom agreement?
{: #custom-agreement}

Any previously approved custom agreements are saved and still valid. If you need to upload a new version of the custom agreement for review and approval, you can do this from the My company page. On the My company page, click **Edit** and expand the **Upload the custom agreement that you company has made with IBM Cloud**. You can drag and upload the custom agreement file, and it is reviewed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}.
