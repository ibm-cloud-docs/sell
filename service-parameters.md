# Using custom service parameters
{: #service_parameters3p}

All new services must be [onboarded through Partner Center](/docs/sell?topic=sell-get-started). All existing products will be migrated to the new management tool called Partner Center Sell by 31 May 2022. Refrain from making changes to your records during this time. As part of the migration, all of your data will be retained, and when the migration is complete we will notify you by email about how you can review and validate your record.
{: important}

You can use service parameters to collect and add additional data points to a provisioning call when an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} customer creates a service instance. The data is passed to the service broker and is used in the provisioning action that is executed by the service provider. This action supports additional preferences and configures which specific service a customer should select. 

As you start working with custom service parameters, see [Service parameter definitions and examples](/docs/sell?topic=sell-service_parameters_def_examples). 

## Adding custom service parameters to your offering 
{: #add-custom-service-parameters}

As a third-party provider, you have the option to add custom service parameters to your offering:

1. Log in to the [console](/login){: external}. 
2. Go to the [resource management console dashboard](/onboarding/dashboard){: external}, and click the **Offering** tab. 
3. Enter a valid JSON in the **Custom Service Parameter** input field. 

The custom service parameters are published onto the Global Catalog deployment object when you are publishing a deployment for a plan. 
{: note}

After you add custom service parameters, you can go to the console page for the service to review the parameters as you create a plan.

To publish a deployment for a plan, complete the following steps: 
1. Go the [resource management console dashboard](/onboarding/dashboard){: external}, and click the **Deployment** tab.
2. Click **Catalog Deployments** &gt; **Add Deployment**. 
3. Select a plan to configure and click **Add**. 
4. You can edit custom service parameters in the deployment JSON. To edit the deployment JSON, click **Catalog Deployments** and select **Edit JSON**.

## Using service parameters to create customized input fields 
{: #parameters_input}

You can use service parameters to create customized input fields in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service creation user interface. The values that are entered by the user are sent to your service broker on the request to provision the service. The `parameters` attribute can be added as an array to your JSON, you can create custom input fields of the following types: text, password, dropdown, checkbox, or radio. The `parameters` attribute should be added within the `metadata.service` entry under the JSON response of `GET <resource-catalog>/api/v1/<service-id>?complete=true`.

If a parameter is set to required, the `parameters.options.value` cannot be an empty string because it violates the parameter validation.

`userDefinedService` is deprecated. Previously, when provisioning a service, custom service parameters can be added to your JSON by nesting them within the `userDefinedService` entry. Do not add these parameters under `userDefinedService`; instead, add them directly under `metadata`.
{: deprecated}

## Adding service parameters to translated metadata
{: #service_parameters_translation}

To specify custom service parameters in translated metadata, the i18n version should be placed in the `metadata.i18n.<lang>.parameters` attribute.
