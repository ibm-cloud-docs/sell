# Onboard a broker
{: #broker-onboard}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="10m"}

This tutorial walks you through how to onboard a broker that you can use to connect a pricing plan to your third-party service. When users create instances of your service from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog, the broker manages the lifecycle of those instances, and connects the service to the applications that developers are building.
{: shortdesc}

This tutorial is one of five in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish a third-party service to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. As you complete the tutorial, adjust each step to fit your product's needs.
