# Onboarding software to your private catalog
{: #sw-validate}

The process to onboard your software includes importing a version to your private catalog, configuring the deployment details, setting any license requirements, and validating that the version can be successfully installed on the target infrastructure that you require.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #sw-validate-prereqs}

1. Upload your source code to a release in your GitHub, GitLab, or Azure repository. For more information, see [Setting up your source code repository](/docs/sell?topic=sell-source-repo-setup).
1. Verify that you're using a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account. See [Viewing your account type](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#view-acct-type) for more information.
1. Make sure you're assigned the editor role on the catalog management service. See [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services).
1. Set up the test environment that was previously created for you:

    * Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Schematics plug-in. See [Setting up the CLI](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-cli).

    * Upload a readme file that contains your product installation instructions to your source repository. See [Setting up your source code repository](/docs/sell?topic=sell-source-repo-setup).
    * For containerized apps:
        * Create your [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started) or [Red Hat OpenShift cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-getting-started).
        * For deployments to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service, [set up your Helm chart](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm).
        * For deployments to Red Hat OpenShift, set up your [Helm chart](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-helm) or [Operator](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-operators).
    * For virtual server images:
        * Review the list of [supported images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).
        * If required, create your [Terraform template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started). Virtual server images for VPC do not require a Terraform template.
        * Create an instance of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) and add your image to a bucket.

## Importing a version to your private catalog
{: #sw-validate-add}
{: ui}

Complete the following steps to import a version of your software to your private catalog. Your private catalog was created for you as part of [Getting set up to sell software](/docs/sell?topic=sell-sw-getting-started).

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **My products**.
1. Select the product that you're onboarding.
1. From the Software tab, click **Import a version**.
1. Select your deployment method.
1. Select whether you are adding your product from a private or public repository. For Operators, select your source repository and then choose private or public repository.
1. Enter your source URL.

    You can review the following list of supported formats per software type:

    * Helm chart: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/ibm-helm`
    * Node-RED Operator: `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/operator-bundle-sample/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.3.tar.gz`
    * Operator bundle from a {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} registry: For an example, select the `Akka Cluster Operator` from the list of available Operators in the Certified repository.
    * OVA image: `https://github.com/gcatalog/OVA-sample/blob/main/ova-sample.yaml`
    * Terraform template: `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-sample/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.0.tar.gz`
    * Virtual server image with Terraform: `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/releases/download/v1.0/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample.tar.gz`
    * Virtual server image for VPC: Select an image from the list of available images that were imported into your VPC, or import a new image to your account.

    A virtual server image for VPC can only be added to one product within one private catalog at a time. If the virtual server image you want to import is already imported into another product, you must remove the image from that product or delete the product before you add the virtual server image to a new product.
    {: note}

    If you're adding your product from a private repository, you can choose to provide a personal access token or you can use a secret. Instead of giving users a personal access token, you can give them access to a secret, add the token to a secret, and centrally manage all tokens and access the secret allows.

    

    * If you're using a personal access token, select **No** to indicate that you aren't using a secret and provide your personal access token.
    * If you're using a secret, select **Yes** and click **Select from Secrets Manager**. Select your service instance, secret group, and secret. If you don't see your secret, make sure you're using the correct secret group and service instance.

    The message `No service instance available` might be displayed if you haven't created a secret or if you don't have the correct access to use secrets, even if you have service instances that are created.
    {: note}

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Next**.

If you are importing a virtual server image for VPC, the readme file is not automatically generated. Copy and paste the contents of the [readme file template](/media/docs/downloads/software/sw-readme-tab-template.md){: external} and make updates as needed.
{: note}

## Validating the product
{: #sw-validate-validate-product}
{: ui}

The steps to validate your product can vary based on the type of software that you're onboarding.

1. From the Validate product tab, configure your validation target, and click **Next**. This step applies only to Helm charts and Operators.
1. Configure your workspace, and click **Next**. This step applies only to Helm charts, Operators, Terraform templates, and virtual server images with Terraform.

{: tip}

## Validating your software by using the API
{: #sw-validate-edits-api}
{: api}

You can validate your software by calling the [Catalog Management API](/apidocs/resource-catalog/private-catalog?code=java#validate-install){: external}.

```java
String authRefreshToken = "{authRefreshToken}";
String versionLocator = "{versionLocator}";
ValidationInstallOptions installOptions = new ValidationInstallOptions.Builder().xAuthRefreshToken(authRefreshToken).versionLocId(versionLocator).build();
Response<Void> response = service.validationInstall(installOptions).execute();
System.out.println(response.getResult());
```
{: codeblock}
{: java}

```javascript
versionLocator = "{versionLocator}";
authRefreshToken = "{authRefreshToken}";
response = await service.validationInstall({ 'versionLocatorId': versionLocator, 'xAuthRefreshToken': authRefreshToken });
console.log(response);
```
{: codeblock}
{: javascript}

```python
authRefreshToken="{authRefreshToken}"
versionLocator = "{versionLocator}"
response = self.service.validation_install(version_locator_id=versionLocator, x_auth_refresh_token=authRefreshToken)
print(response)
```
{: codeblock}
{: python}

```go
versionLocator := "{versionLocator}"
authRefreshToken := "{authRefreshToken}"
installOptions := service.NewValidationInstallOptions(versionLocator, authRefreshToken)
response, _ := service.ValidationInstall(installOptions)
fmt.Println(response)
```
{: codeblock}
{: go}
