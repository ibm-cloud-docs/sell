# Defining your pricing plan
{: #service-pricing-info}

When you onboard your service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you must define a pricing plan. If you have detailed knowledge about how you want to charge users for your service, you can provide that information in your plan. However, you can start by enabling a free plan, and then set up a paid plan later if your needs change. Currently, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} supports free and paid usage-based pricing plans.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-pricing}

Before you submit a pricing plan for approval, you must sign the required agreements, documentation, and provide the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) that applies to your product. The prerequisites might differ depending on whether you have a free or usage-based pricing plan.

For free plans:

* Provide the ECCN that applies to your product.
* Provide the UNSPSC that applies to your product.
* Confirm the digital platform reseller agreement.

For paid, usage-based plans:

* Provide the ECCN that applies to your product.
* Provide the UNSPSC that applies to your product.
* Submit your tax and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) information for paid plans to set up and receive payment disbursements for usage.
* Confirm the digital platform reseller agreement.

Depending on the type of plan you're adding, complete each prerequisite by using the following instructions.

### Submitting tax and EFT forms
{: #submit-tax-eft}

For services that you offer on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with a paid, usage-based pricing plan, you receive disbursements based on the usage in accordance with your pricing structure. To receive disbursements, you must complete and submit the EFT form and tax documentation.

To provide tax and EFT information, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **Payments to me**.
1. Download the relevant EFT form, and complete it.

    One of three types of bank documents is required to be submitted with the form. You can submit a scanned copy of a voided check or a bank letter that is signed and stamped by the bank. If you are outside of the United States, you can alternatively provide an online bank statement. The document that you provide must include the bank name, account number, routing number (or bank key or ABA), and the account holder's name.
    {: important}

1. Download the relevant tax documentation, and complete it.
1. Submit the completed documentation and bank document by email to `apremit@us.ibm.com`. You must include `cloud.onboarding@ibm.com` on the email.
1. Select **I confirm that I completed and emailed all of the required documents.**.

### Providing the ECCN
{: #service-eccn}

To start defining your pricing model, you must provide the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that applies to your product. If you don't have your ECCN, you can find it on the [Commerce Control List](https://www.bis.gov/licensing/classify-your-item#WhatisanECCN?){: external}.

You must submit your tax and EFT documents and receive approval before you can provide the ECCN if you're using a usage-based pricing plan.
{: note}

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **My products**.
1. Select the service that you're onboarding and go to the **Pricing** page.
1. Click **Add ECCN** and provide the ECCN for your service.
1. Click **Add**.

If you need to update your ECCN after you add it, you must contact {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support. To contact support, you can use the following methods:

* If you have a valid Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can click **Chat with IBM** to connect with a support engineer.
* Pay-as-you-go or subscription accounts can also contact support by phone: +1-866-403-7638.

### Providing the UNSPSC
{: #service-unspsc}

You must provide your ECCN before the UNSPSC.
{: note}

In addition to ECCN, you must provide the UNSPSC that applies to your product. The UNSPSC is required for both free and usage-based pricing plans. If you need help with selecting the UNSPSC for your service, see [How to select UNSPSC codes?](https://help.ungm.org/hc/en-us/articles/360013132940-How-to-select-UNSPSC-codes){: external}. Providing your UNSPSC is a required step in the onboarding process.

To provide the UNSPSC code that applies to your product, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **My products**.
1. Select the service that you're onboarding and go to the **Pricing** page.
1. Click **Add UNSPSC** and select the UNSPSC code for your service.
1. Click **Add**.

### Accepting agreement terms and conditions
{: #service-confirm-dra}

Depending on the type of plans you are adding for your product, you must sign the agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of providing a product in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Or, you can upload a custom digital provider agreement in `.pdf`, `.doc`, or `.docx` file format.

Custom digital provider agreements must be reviewed and approved by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, which increases the time it takes for you to complete the onboarding process. The uploaded files are scanned for viruses, which might take a few minutes to complete. If a virus is detected, it is recommended to run another virus scan on your file, and then try uploading it again.
{: note}

#### Digital platform reseller agreement
{: #dra}

If you plan to offer free or paid, usage-based pricing plans, it is required to review and submit the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement.

Complete the following steps to review and submit the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Digital Platform Reseller Agreement:

## Adding pricing plans
{: #add-plans}

You can choose to add free and paid pricing plans. Ensure that you review and finalize all details of the pricing plan before you submit it.

For more information on how to change a submitted pricing plan, see [Changing a pricing plan](/docs/sell?topic=sell-change-plan).

You must complete all of the prerequisites from the Before you begin section to finalize a pricing plan.

### Adding a free plan
{: #add-plan-free}

   {: note}

1. Click **Save**.

### Adding a paid pricing plan
{: #add-plan-paid}

By adding a usage-based pricing plan, you are indicating that you offer your product as a paid integrated product, and customers need to pay to use it. All information that is entered on the **Add plan** panel is displayed to customers in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog to help them purchase your service.

When you add a usage-based pricing plan, you provide your suggested retail pricing information. However, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} reserves the right to set the final pricing for any product that is offered to customers in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
{: important}

To add a paid pricing plan for your service, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center** > **My products**.

   {: note}

1. Click **Save**.

Before you can submit your pricing plan for approval, you must complete the following tasks:



* If you had to skip the step to link your broker to the plan because you didn't have one yet, start to develop your broker, and come back to link it to your plan when you're done.
* [Add metrics to your plan](/docs/sell?topic=sell-service-add-metrics) to determine how customers are charged, and request pricing approval.
* [Add plan features](#service-add-feature) to describe why a customer might want to choose a specific plan.
* [Test the pricing and usage](/docs/sell?topic=sell-service-add-metrics#submit-evidence) from a customer's perspective and provide evidence from your testing to get the final approval for your pricing plan.



### Listing pricing plan features
{: #service-add-feature}

If you completed the steps to define your pricing plan, you can add a list of features for the plan. These features uniquely identify your product's attributes and differentiate your pricing plan from others. By providing a list of features for your product, you can help customers choose the most suitable pricing plan for their use case.

You can add up to five features for your product, but you must add at least one. The first feature that you add appears more prominently. Include the most important and differentiating details as the first feature.
