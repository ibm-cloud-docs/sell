# Developing an authentication and authorization flow for your service
{: #develop-auth-authz}

When you onboard your product to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Partner Center, you can develop an authentication flow to identify users when they use your services, and an authorization flow to validate that they have permission to access a specific service instance.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #develop-oauth-prereq}

Before you can start developing an authentication flow, you must have a client ID and a secret configured.

### Configuring your client ID and secret
{: #configure-client-id}

To develop an authentication flow, you need a client ID and a secret, and a redirect URL. The client ID is generated to identify your service, along with the secret, which is the password for your service. Your client ID is not confidential since it is publicly identified. However, the secret is confidential and is only known to the application and the authorization server. You can create and manage you client ID in Partner Center. A redirect URL is the host URL for your service that users are redirected to after a successful authentication.

The following example shows redirect URLs:

```text
https://<myapp>.cloud.ibm.com/integrate/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback <-- for testing locally
```

To generate your client ID, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center > My products**.
1. Select the product that you're onboarding, and go to the **Brokers** page.
1. Click **Set up IBM Cloud SSO**.
1. Add owners who can manage the client ID.

    Only owners are able to view, edit and delete the client ID setup, or add extra redirect URLs. Users who create the client ID are automatically added to the owners list, and not able to remove themselves.
    {: note}

1. Add the redirect URL, and click **Next**. You can add more than one URL and use these as the `redirect_uri` in the upcoming tasks. The `redirect_uri` value refers to the redirect URL.
1. Save your credentials. Copy the password for your service that is generated along with the client ID. You are not able to retrieve your password later.

    If you don't have your password, you can delete and re-create your previously created client ID to generate another one.
    {: note}

1. Click **Done**.

## Step 1: Finding the regional endpoint
{: #auth-step1}

After you successfully generate your client ID, you can start developing the oAuth flow. First, find the IAM regional endpoint for UI login that is closer to your deployed application by calling the following endpoint:

`https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/.well-known/openid-configuration`

See the following curl command as an example:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "issuer": "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://iam-region2.cloud.ibm.com/identity/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://iam-region2.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token",
...
}
```

This request can be done when the application starts, and again if the `authorization_endpoint` fails. You can cache the `authorization_endpoint` value for a short amount of time, and refresh after the cache expires or an error occurs.

## Step 2: Redirecting users to your dashboard_url
{: #auth-step2}

When users navigate to your `dashboard_url`, redirect the browser to the following URL to check whether they are logged in to your application and have the access token:

`<authorization_endpoint>?client_id=<your-client-id>&redirect_uri=<your-redirect-uri>&response-type=code&state=<your-resource-instance-id>`

The `redirect_uri` value refers to the redirect URL that you set up in the [Configuring your client ID and secret](/docs/sell?topic=sell-develop-auth-authz&interface=ui#develop-oauth-prereq) step.
{: note}

* If a user is logged in, they are immediately redirected. The browser does a callback to redirect the URI with a `code` response parameter and `state` value.

* If a user is not logged in, a login prompt appears. After a successful login, the browser does a callback to redirect the URI with a `code` response parameter and `state` value.

## Step 3: Calling the access token endpoint
{: #auth-step3}

After the user successfully logged in, exchange the code that you received in Step 2 for the access token of the user by calling the access token endpoint.

### POST request to the token endpoint
{: #token-endpoint}

To obtain an access token, you must include the following headers and parameters:

#### Headers
{: #auth-headers}

- `Authorization: Basic [client id]:[client secret]`
- `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `Accept: application/json`

#### Parameters
{: #auth-parameters}

- `client_id=[client ID]`
- `client_secret=[client secret]`
- `grant_type=authorization_code`
- `response_type=cloud_iam`
- `redirect_uri=[this parameter refers to the same URL from Step 1]`
- `code=[code from callback]`

See the required headers and parameters included in the following POST request example:

```bash
curl -k -X POST \
  -u "<your-client-id>:<your-client-secret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=<your-client-id>" \
  --data-urlencode "client_secret=<your-client-secret>" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  --data-urlencode "response_type=cloud_iam" \
  --data-urlencode "code=<code-from-the-callback>" \
  --data-urlencode "redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>" \
  "https://iam-region2.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token"
```
{: codeblock}

#### Access token response
{: #access-response}

After you submit a POST request in the previous task, you receive a response with the access token.

See the following example of a successful access token response:

```bash
{
  "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiI......XmpBTIDdR5w",
  "refresh_token": "SPrXw5tBE3......KBQ+luWQVY=",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "expiration": 1473188353
}
```
{: codeblock}

Make sure to store the user's `access_token` value that's returned in the access token response as it is used during user authorization.
{: note}

## Validating user authorization
{: #validate-user-authz}

As a way to validate that your users have permission to access a specific service instance, you can develop an authorization flow. Before you begin, complete the following prerequisites:

* You must have IAM set up for your service. Contact your onboarding specialist, who can assist you with the set up.
* Use an API key that is associated with your service ID. You can find the service ID that is generated for your service on the **Dashboard** tab in Partner Center. You can also use an API key that you already generated for specific tasks for your service.

### Step 1: Generating an IAM access token by using an API key
{: #authz-step1}

To begin the authorization flow, you must get an IAM access token by using an API key. For more information on how to obtain an IAM access token for a service ID by using an API key, see the [IAM Identity Services](/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#gettoken-apikey) API docs.

The access token that you receive is valid only for thirty minutes and can be reused as many times as needed during that time. It's recommended to cache the access token.
{: note}

### Step 2: Validating user permissions
{: #user-athz-service-step2}

Now that you have the access token, and you authenticated your user, you need to validate that they have the permission to access the dashboard of a service instance. Accessing the dashboard of a service instance is the only action that can be used to validate user authorization.

You must decode the information that is included in the user's access token. After the token is decoded, you can use that information to call IAM to check whether the user is authorized to access the service dashboard.

#### Decoding the user's access token
{: #decode-access-token}

Decode the user's access token, which was returned during step 3. The access token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that can be decoded by using any JWT-compliant library.

After the token is decoded, you can view the following information:

```bash
{
  "iam_id": "IBMid-XXXXXXX",
  "id": "IBMid-XXXXXXX",
  "realmid": "IBMid",
  "identifier": "XXXXXXX",
  "given_name": "Don",
  "family_name": "Quixote",
  "name": "Don Quixote",
  "email": "quixote@email.com",
  "sub": "quixote@email.com",
  "account": {
    "bss": "123123123123123"
  },
  "iat": 1522114004,
  "exp": 1522117604,
  "iss": "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity",
  "grant_type": "urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey",
  "scope": "openid <your serviceName>",
  "client_id": "bx",
  "acr": 1,
  "amr": [
    "pwd"
  ]
}
```
{: codeblock}

The `scope` field value refers to the service programmatic name.
{: note}

#### Calling IAM to check user authorization
{: #call-iam-user-authz}

After decoding the user's access token, call IAM to check whether the user is authorized to access the service dashboard by passing the body of the user's access token.

Review the following example of an IAM call:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access token from step 1>" \
  -d '[ \
    { \
      "subject" : \
      { \
      "accessTokenBody": "<The part of the user's token between the dots. This contains all the token claims data, but excludes the headers and signature.>"
      }, \
      "resource" : \
      { \
        "crn" : "<resource instance CRN>" \
      }, \
      action : <your service name> + ".dashboard.view" \
    } \
  ]' \
  https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/v2/authz
```
{: codeblock}

The `crn` field value refers to the service instance ID.
{: note}

## IAM token scoping for third-party service providers
{: #iam-token-scope}

User access tokens that are created with your client ID can be used to access only your service APIs. Requests to other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} APIs that use this token are denied access, even if the user has an appropriate policy configured.

As part of third-party integration, token scoping is being used to ensure that tokens have the minimal access scope that is needed to accomplish the user's goals. To facilitate this, IAM tokens access is based on the client ID that created the token.
