# Onboarding a virtual server image with Terraform to a private catalog
{: #vsimage-onboard}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}

{: toc-completion-time="45m"}

Onboarding virtual server images with Terraform is deprecated. After 29 March 2024, onboarding virtual server images with Terraform is no longer supported as a delivery method, which means that no new virtual server images with Terraform can be onboarded. Existing VSIs in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog will be available to use, but to take advantage of version updates and ensure continued support, onboard virtual server images for Virtual Private Cloud directly. For more information, see [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial).
{: deprecated}

This tutorial walks you through how to onboard a virtual server image with Terraform to a private catalog. By completing this tutorial, you learn how to import the virtual server image from a GitHub repository, configure the deployment and other details, and validate that you can deploy the image to a target {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC).
{: shortdesc}

This tutorial is one of four in a series that demonstrates how to onboard and publish a [sample virtual server image with Terraform](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/tree/v1.0){: external} to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. As you complete the tutorial, adapt each step to fit your product's needs.

This tutorial includes deploying the virtual server image to a target VPC. As a result, you will incur associated {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure charges.
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #vsimage-onboard-prereqs}

1. Create an instance of [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) and upload your image to a bucket.
2. Create your [VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started).
3. [Import your custom image to all regions](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample/tree/main#import-your-custom-image-to-all-supported-regions){: external} in which you want your software to be available.
4. Create your [Terraform template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-create-tf-config).

{: step}

From the Configure version tab, you can review your version details. There are no actions that you need to take. After you review your version details, click **Next**.

## Configure the deployment values
{: #vsimage-onboard-cfgdeploy}
{: step}

After you review the version details, you're ready to configure the deployment values.

1. If you need to specify the Terraform runtime version that you want Schematics to use, click the **Override the default Terraform runtime version** checkbox and enter a version.
1. From the Configure the deployment details section, click **Add deployment values**.
1. Select the **Parameter** checkbox to select all options, and click **Add**.
1. To customize which parameters are required for users to specify during the installation and which ones are hidden from users altogether, select a parameter and click **Edit**. Mark the checkboxes to configure the values and click **Save**. For the purposes of this tutorial, configure each parameter as described in the following table.

| Parameter | Description | Required for users to specify? | Hidden from users? |
| --- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| **`TF_VERSION`** | The version of the Terraform engine that's used in the Schematics workspace. | False | True |
| **`region`** | The region in which the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance is located. | True | False |
| **`ssh_key_name`** | The name of the public SSH key to use when creating the virtual server instance. | True | False |

## Review requirements
{: #vsi-review-reqs}

You must complete validation and any other requirements to publish your virtual server image.

## Next steps
{: #vsimage-onboard-next}

The virtual server image isn't yet publicly available to other accounts. Use a REST API to make the image public so that users can use it to create virtual server instances. For more information, see [Update the visibility of your image](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/isv-vsi-product-deploy-sample#update-the-visibility-of-your-image-patch-api){: external}.

After you make the virtual server image public, you can return to the Partner Center and publish it to the catalog. For more information, see [Publishing a virtual server image to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/docs/sell?topic=sell-vsimage-publish).
