# Adding a deployable architecture to Partner Center
{: #create-da-product}

As the first step in the onboarding process, you can either add the deployable architecture to Partner Center, or you can import an existing one from a private catalog.
{: shortdesc}

A deployable architecture is cloud automation for deploying a common architectural pattern that combines one or more cloud resources. It is designed to provide simplified deployment by users, scalability, and modularity. A deployable architecture incorporates one or more modules. Deployable architectures are coded in Terraform, which you configure with input variables to achieve the behavior that you want. For more information, see [What is a deployable architecture?](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understand-module-da&interface=ui#what-is-da).



## Adding your deployable architecture to Partner Center
{: #add-new-da}

To add your deployable architecture in Partner Center and start onboarding it, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **Navigation Menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Partner Center > My products**.
1. From the **My products** page, click **Create**.
1. Click **Create a product**, and click **Next > Start now**.

## Importing an existing product

1. Select the private catalog that contains your product and click **Select catalog**.
1. Select the product that you want to import and click **Import**.
