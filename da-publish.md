# Publishing your deployable architecture
{: #da-publish}

As the last step in the onboarding process, you can submit a request to publish your third-party deployable architecture to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} catalog. When you publish your deployable architecture to the catalog, you can choose to publish it to all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} users in the catalog or to only specific accounts. If you choose to publish to specific accounts, your product is available only for users in those accounts.
